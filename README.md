# Natural-Language-Processing-Amazon-Reviews-Sentimental-Analysis

#- In this project, we are going to perform Sentimental Analysis of Amazon Reviews.

We are going to use Bag Of Words Technique to predict positive and negative reviews. In the 21sy century, only 21 % data is available in structured format. Vast amount of data is in text format which is highly unstructured in nature. In order to get necessary information from this kind of data, text mining and Natural Language Processing is important. NLP is part of Artificial Intelligence which deals with human languages.

In the given Juoyter Notebook, I have explained steps to perform NLP using Bag of Words technique and I have predicted Positive and Negative reviews using Naive Bayes Algorithm. The accuracy of the model is 83 %.
